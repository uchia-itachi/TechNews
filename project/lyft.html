<h1>Lyft’s self-driving technology finds momentum in Concord</h1><br>

		It's not just Uber and Waymo racing to put self-driving cars on the road. Ride-hailing app Lyft has been building its self-driving car program, and on Thursday, its fleet got a training boost.<br>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">
		Lyft announced today that it would soon begin testing its autonomous vehicles at GoMentum Station, a 5,000-acre proving ground in Concord, California. The vehicles it plans to test are being designed and developed by Lyft’s own in-house engineering team. It’s a major shift for the ride-hailing company that has typically relied on partners with more advanced technology.


	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">
		“By partnering with GoMentum Station, we’re able to test our self-driving systems in a secure facility and advance our technology in an efficient way,” said Luc Vincent, vice president of engineering at Lyft, in a statement announcing the GoMentum partnership.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">
		The closed training facility is where the local county transportation agency brings together car makers, tech companies, researchers, academics, and other specialists to develop new transportation ideas — and see if the vehicles can take it.
	</p>

	<p style="font-size: 20px;">
		Acura and Toyota both have put autonomous vehicles through the obstacle course-like challenge at GoMentum's proving grounds. City-like roads and other safety scenarios make it a laboratory for autonomous driving.	
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">

		Last year, Lyft laid out plans for its Palo Alto, California, self-driving car facility. Those vehicles developed at the Level 5 Engineering Center are now getting put to the test.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">
		Lyft didn’t provide an update on the progress of its self-driving cars, aside from two photos that tell us little about the type of technology the company is relying on to power its vehicles. Even though it’s the second largest ride-hail provider in the US, it still lags significantly behind its rival Uber, which has deployed self-driving vehicles on public roads in multiple cities.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 20px;">
		The GoMentum Station is one of 10 officially designated autonomous vehicle proving grounds identified by the US Department of Transportation in 2017 as a way to help set the direction of policy-making and testing procedures going forward. Both Honda and Toyota are currently testing self-driving vehicles there. It has about 20 miles of paved roads and a cluster of barracks and buildings that provide an urban environment. It is also a secure location where companies can test cars away from the prying eyes of their competitors.
