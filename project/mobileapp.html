		Mobile applications are no longer a luxury, but have become a necessity of day to day life. One of the biggest challenges that app developers faced before was creating applications that work well on multiple platforms. Not anymore; here we are sharing the top 9 cross-platform mobile app development tools that will help in designing cutting edge and productive apps in a short duration of time.<br>
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 18px;">
		The latest app code supports the concept of write once, run anywhere (WORA). The developer writes code once on one platform, and runs it on multiple platforms. The purpose of such tools is to save time and effort on the part of the developer. Developers can reuse the code and can design apps that can work efficiently on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, Windows, and many more.

	Mobile Application Development Platforms (MADP) have become a must in the business world, with practically every organization looking to add an app to their existing site, and entrepreneurs looking to bring their mobile application visions to life. What once required thousands of dollars, a vast knowledge in coding and a whole lot of time can now be done simply and cost effectively with a mobile app development platform. So if you thought you knew who’s out there when it comes to cross-platform development, think again! Here are 2018’s top mobile app development platforms. Now all that’s left for you to do is take your pick

    </div>
	<p style="font-size: 18px;">
		This cross-device platform helps in developing industry-based applications. The platform supports rapid application development. The developer can write code in Java and the application will be tested and verified with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codenameone.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" style="color: blue;">Codename One’s</a>&nbsp;simulator devices and test automation tools. The framework supports popular IDEs like NetBeans, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA. The most interesting feature about its build server is that the developer can build native iOS apps as well as native Windows apps without a Mac machine or Windows PC. The platform is recommended for developing iOS apps.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size: 18px">
		<strong>Cons:</strong>
		&nbsp;Codename's graphic UI does not match the requirements of large projects and its visual themes are not updated. Another major flaw is that all the event handlers are stored in a single file, which makes the development part more cumbersome.

	<p style="font-size: 22px;">
		<h1><strong>8. PhoneGap</strong></h1>
	</p>

	<div style="width: 75%">
		<img src="phonegap.jpg" style="width: 100%">
    </div>

	<p style="font-size: 18px">
		This open-source platform can make building cross-platform apps a lot easier. The tool works best for mobile applications that do not rely on the device’s native features for performance. A product of Adobe, one can use it to translate code from HTMT5, CSS, and JavaScript. The &nbsp;<a href="http://phonegap.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" style="color: blue;">PhoneGap</a>
		&nbsp;platform allows the developer to design app for platforms like iPhone, Android, Windows, and BlackBerry. This free resource is high in demand among developers due to its features and support that it offers.
	</p>
     <p style="font-size: 18px">
		<strong>Cons:</strong>

		<a href="http://www.redbytes.in/xamarin-cross-platform-development-company/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" style="color: blue;">Xamarin</a>&nbsp;has made it possible for the developers to design native apps for multiple platforms using only C# code base. The tool allows developers to use the same IDE, language, and APIs everywhere. Xamarin cross-platform development has been adopted by big names like Microsoft, Foursquare, IBM, and Dow Jones. If a developer wants to use Ruby or C#, then it is one of the most suitable development platforms for them.
