	<h2 style="margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">Pivotal: Helping big companies do what Google does</h2>
	<img src="pivotal.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">
	<p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Name:</bold>&nbsp Pivotal<br>
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Headquarters:</bold>&nbsp sanfranciso<br>
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Funding to date</bold>&nbsp 1.7 billion in 3 rounds<br><br>
	Pivotal started life as a small software consultancy, got gobbled up by EMC, and spun back out a few years later as its own entity.<br><br>
	Nowadays, there are two facets to Pivotal's business: First, it provides a "boot camp" for developers at even the largest technology companies, teaching them how to build software at the same pace as a Google or a Facebook. Second, it provides the technology and tools they need to fully take advantage of that approach.<br><br>
	In 2017, Pivotal inked a key deal with Google and VMware to help those big companies build bridges to bring software and data from their own data centers into the cloud, setting itself up to have a great year in 2018 and beyond.<br>

	<h2 style="margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">Slack: The fastest-growing enterprise app</h2>
	<img src="slack.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">
	<p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Name:</bold>&nbsp Slack<br>
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Headquarters:</bold>&nbsp sanfranciso<br>
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Funding to date</bold>&nbsp $790 million in 10 rounds<br><br>
	Slack is on a tear: Earlier this year, the work chat app announced it was on a $200 million annualized run rate, followed not long after by rumors that Amazon could buy the company for as much as $9 billion. Those rumors were dispelled in September, when Slack raised a monster $250 million round led by SoftBank, boosting the company's valuation to $5.1 billion.<br><br>
	The success of Slack has inspired plenty of competition: Microsoft has doubled down on Teams, its own take on a work chat app. And Atlassian, proprietors of the popular HipChat, has unveiled Stride, a new app directly aimed at Slack.<br><br>
	But it seems like there's no stopping Slack, and it's going into 2018 in a good position.<br>

	<img src="avid.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">
	<p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Name:</bold>&nbsp AvidXchange<br>
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Headquarters:</bold>&nbsp  Charlotte, North Carolina<br>
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Funding to date</bold>&nbsp  $545 million in 5 rounds<br><br>
	AvidXchange helps companies automate their invoicing and has caught the eye of credit card giant Mastercar<br><br>
	In June, it landed a big partnership with Mastercard, along with a $300 million round of investment led by Mastercard, with participation from Silicon valley investor Peter Thiel and Canada's second largest public pension fund.<br><br>
	This round gave AvidXchange a $1.4 billion valuation, landing it in the unicorn club.<br>
	<br>
	Avidxchange is the most well-funded private venture backed company in North Carolina. Since its launch in 2000, the enterprise tech company has raised a total of $545 million in traditional venture capital investments and private equity.<br>

	<h2 style="margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">Plenty: Agri-tech startup backed by a who's who in tech</h2>
	<img src="plenty.png" style="width: 100%; margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">
	<p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left:20px; overflow: hidden;">
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Name:</bold>&nbsp Plenty<br>
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Headquarters:</bold>&nbsp  South San Francisco<br>
	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Funding to date</bold>&nbsp   $226 million in 3 rounds<br><br>
	Plenty is billed by its investors as "the future of agriculture." It uses LED lights, micro-sensor technology, and big data analysis to help farmers grow produce indoors, on vertical racks.<br><br>
	This allows food to be grown in urban centers nearer to its grocery store customers, which extends shelf life and lowers costs.<br><br>
	Founded in 2013, Plenty has raised over $200 million by a who's who including Jeff Bezos fund Bezos Expeditions, Eric Schmidt's fund, Innovation Endeavors and Softbank<br>

	<bold style="font-size: 20px;">Funding to date</bold>&nbsp  $305.4 million in 8 rounds<br><br>
	There's no denying that Amazon Web Services rules the cloud computing market. It's a $16 billion juggernaut that's getting bigger all the time.<br><br>
	But DigitalOcean proves there's still room to compete.<br><br>
	It focuses exclusively on smaller developers and their teams, aiming to provide a better programming environment for building their software. Just recently, DigitalOcean revealed to <a href="index.html" style="color: blue;">Tech News</a> that it's on a $175 million annualized run rate, and it's profitable by some measures, it says.<br>
